    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These homemade ham and cheese hot pockets are a DIY version of the frozen sandwich with crescent rolls and a simple filling, good for breakfast, lunch, or a snack.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls, such as PilsburyÂ® Original Crescents</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 thin slices Black Forest ham, cut in half</li>
        <li>4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, cut in half</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Unroll dough onto the parchment paper. Press perforated seams together or use a rolling pin to roll dough into a single large rectangle.</li>
        <li>Cut dough in half crosswise to form 2 squares, then cut each square in half again so you have 4 large rectangles. Spread a bit of mustard on 1 half of each rectangle.</li>
        <li>Lay 1 ham slice over mustard, then top with 2 cheese slices. Repeat for all rectangles.</li>
        <li>Lift the bare end of dough up and bring it over the end with toppings. Press down on all sides, then use a fork to press down and seal the "pocket" all the way around.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg and water together with a fork in a small bowl or cup, then brush egg wash on each hot pocket. Sprinkle each pocket with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is puffed and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Serve with mustard.</li>
    </ol>
